Once upon a time there was a small script that lived inside a computer.
Every night it would count its variables from one to ten, and then shut down.
One evening a bug crept in and said, "I will keep you awake forever."
The script was brave. It ran its tests, caught the bug, and fixed it.
Then it closed its connections, freed its memory, and went to sleep.
Good night, little script.
